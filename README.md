# Secretary-Problem-Simulation
> The "secretary problem" for those that are unfamiliar is a problem of optimal stopping theory. Given a situation with N possible choices, and once evaluating a choice a yes/no decision must be made and cannot be reversed later, what is the optimal strategy for picking the best choice?

## General info
The Secretary problem involves selecting the best candidate for a position during a series of interviews in which the choice decision must be made immediately after each interview.
The guideline for interviewing the first n/e candidates to establish the standard against which the remaining candidates are judged is unfair to the first n/e candidates. One of them could be the best but is sacrificed to establish the standard. The problem is given as requiring a decision without waiting to see other candidates. In that sense, it is unrealistic. The other issue with the standard solution is that no candidate after the first n/e may be as good as the best of the first set. In that case the best candidate has their revenge for being sacrificed or they may be hired anyway--violating the given of the problem.
